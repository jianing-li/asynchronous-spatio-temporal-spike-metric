### Introduction
In this repository, we propose an asynchronous spatio-temporal spike metric considering both spatio-temporal structural properties and polarity attribute for event cameras. As a result, the conditional probability function is firstly introduced to describe the distribution and polarity prior in MSTPPs. Besides, a 3D Gaussian kernel is defined to capture the spatio-temporal structure, and it transforms discrete spikes into the condition intensity function in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Moreover, the distance between asynchronous spikes can be quantified by inner product in RKHS.
